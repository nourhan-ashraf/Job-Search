## Description

The aim of this project was to develop a job search website using a React frontend library integrated with an API. The website offers multiple functionalities to improve the user experience. Users can search for jobs based on keywords or job titles. The job listings provide important details such as company name, location, tags, and posting time. When a user selects a job, they can access comprehensive job descriptions and instructions on how to apply.

I improved the user interface in the most recent update to resemble the Wuzzuf interface. Users now have the choice to either create an account or log in, enabling them to customize their profiles by adding personal information. Additionally, they have the ability to save job listings for future reference.

## Features

- Sign up or log in using an email and password.
- Edit your profile information in your personal profile.
- Search for jobs using keywords and job titles.
- View detailed information about relevant job listings.
- Access job descriptions and application details.
- Explore jobs without signing in.
- Save jobs to revisit them later.
- User-friendly interface for seamless navigation.
